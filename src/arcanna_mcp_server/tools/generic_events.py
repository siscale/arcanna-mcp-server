async def query_arcanna_events(request: QueryEventsRequest) -> List[EventModel]:
    """
    Query events filtered by job IDs, job titles, event IDs, or specific filtering criteria (size, start_date, end_date, filters).
    At least one of 'job_ids', 'job_titles', 'event_ids', 'size', 'filters', 'start_date', or 'end_date' must be provided.
    Both the job_ids and job_title fields may be missing.
    If neither job_ids nor job_titles are provided, the search will include events across all jobs.
    When working with timestamps: the '@timestamp' field represents the original alert/event timestamp, while the 'timestamp_inference' field represents the time it was ingested into Arcanna.
    In case of an internal server error, show the error to the user and do not use any other tool, ask the user how he would like to continue.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    job_ids : int or list of int or None
        Job IDs to filter on.
    job_titles : str or list of str or None
        Job titles to filter on.
    event_ids : str or list of str or None
        Events IDs to filter on.
    decision_points_only : bool or None
         If set to true, only decision points will be included in the events response, excluding the full event.
    count_results_only : bool or None
         If set to true, only the total count of events will be returned, and no events.
    start_date : str or None
        Start date to filter events newer than this date.
        Date format:
          - ISO 8601 date string (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS')
    end_date : str or None
        End date to filter events older than this date.
        Date format:

    date_field : str or None
        The field to be used for date range filtering. Defaults to the '@timestamp' field; use the default field unless the user specifies a different one.
    size : int or None
        Number of events to include in response. If job_ids or job_titles provided it is the number of events per job.
    page : int or None (default: 0)
        Page number, used for pagination. Keep size parameter fixed and increase page size to get more results.
    sort_by_column : str or None
        The field used to sort events. Defaults to the 'timestamp_inference' field; use the default field unless the user specifies a different one.
    sort_order : str or None
        The order in which to sort events by. Defaults to 'desc' order; use the default order unless the user specifies a different one.
    filters : list of dict or None
      Filters to apply to the events returned by the query. If multiple filters are provided, they function as an AND operator between the filters.
